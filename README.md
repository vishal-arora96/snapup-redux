# Snapup Shopping

This e-commerce website is built using React JS, Redux Toolkit, LocalStorage, and React Hooks. It features a dummy JSON API that provides mock product data for the website. The website offers a user-friendly interface with easy navigation to search and purchase products. The homepage displays a variety of products with images, descriptions, and prices, allowing customers to easily find what they are looking for.

The website uses Redux Toolkit to manage the state of the application, ensuring that the data is consistent across all components. React Hooks are used to provide a more efficient way of managing state in functional components.

One of the unique features of this website is the use of LocalStorage, which enables the website to store user preferences, such as their shopping cart, and enable them to continue their shopping experience at a later time. The website also includes a search bar that allows users to search for specific products.
